# Golang Playground

Not much to say at this point other than rather than use the [official Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/) I'd prefer to use my own IDE & terminal and create my own studies of various Go topics.

## To Use

Clone the project to your local Go Workspace.
Modify `main.go` to use the various functions, structs, interfaces defined in the other files.

## TODO

Explain setting up a Go development environment on a Mac.
